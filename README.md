# Estimation of Currency Provisions Using Non-Parametric VaR Methodology

# Business Case: Asset Replacement Project

## Executive Summary
The Asset Replacement Project addresses the need to replace several company assets at the best possible price according to the company’s replacement plans. The project faced significant challenges due to the import nature of many products, lengthy import lead times, supply chain disruptions, and high domestic currency depreciation. This business case outlines the project's context, the selected solution methodology, and its financial implications, demonstrating how the project mitigated currency risk and secured better purchasing conditions, avoiding losses amounting to XX million dollars.

## Introduction
The Asset Replacement Project is designed to replace critical company assets that are essential for operations. The primary objective is to achieve this at the best possible price while managing risks associated with import lead times and currency fluctuations. The business case aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the project’s viability, including an analysis of alternatives, financial implications, and risk mitigation strategies.

## Problem Statement
The company had several assets that needed to be replaced according to its replacement plans. However, many of these assets were imported products with significant import lead times. The external context involved supply chain disruptions caused by the partial closure of global production centers and high domestic currency depreciation. Internally, investment budgets had been structured with tolerance for price variations based on pre-pandemic conditions, which became inadequate post-pandemic.

## Analysis of Alternatives
1. **Do Nothing:** Continue with existing assets until they fail, risking operational inefficiency and potential breakdowns.
   - **Advantages:** No immediate expenditure.
   - **Disadvantages:** High risk of operational disruptions and unplanned expenses.
2. **Immediate Replacement with Existing Budgets:** Replace assets without adjusting for new financial realities.
   - **Advantages:** Quick implementation.
   - **Disadvantages:** High financial risk due to currency fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.
3. **Proposed Solution:** Recalibrate budgets using advanced financial methodologies to mitigate risks and secure better purchasing conditions.
   - **Advantages:** Reduced financial risk, optimized asset replacement costs.
   - **Disadvantages:** Requires comprehensive analysis and recalibration effort.

## Project Description
The proposed solution involves recalibrating all budget items meticulously after the reopening of ports. This includes adjusting import components of the project and re-estimating contingency funds to account for potential exchange rate spikes. The project will utilize the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology to calculate the maximum loss due to exchange rate differentials over the exposure period and a non-parametric estimation to determine the theoretical density function of the euro and the dollar.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Costs:**
  - Initial recalibration and analysis costs.
  - Implementation of VaR methodology and non-parametric estimations.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduced currency risk.
  - Better purchasing conditions.
  - Avoided losses of XX million dollars.
- **ROI:** Calculation based on avoided losses and cost savings achieved through risk mitigation and better negotiation terms.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation
- **Identified Risks:**
  - Continued supply chain disruptions.
  - Further currency depreciation.
  - Inaccurate estimations.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Ongoing monitoring of supply chain conditions.
  - Regular updates to currency risk models.
  - Use of conservative estimates and continuous recalibration.

## Project Governance
- **Governance Structure:**
  - Project Sponsor: Senior Management.
  - Project Manager: Head of Finance.
  - Project Team: Finance Analysts, Procurement Specialists, Risk Management Experts.
- **Roles and Responsibilities:**
  - Sponsor: Oversight and approval.
  - Manager: Execution and coordination.
  - Team: Analysis, recalibration, and implementation.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1:** Detailed analysis and recalibration of budgets.
2. **Phase 2:** Implementation of VaR methodology and non-parametric estimations.
3. **Phase 3:** Negotiation with suppliers using recalibrated budgets.
4. **Phase 4:** Ongoing monitoring and adjustments.
- **Resources Required:** Financial analysis software, skilled personnel, external consultants if necessary.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The Asset Replacement Project, through the application of advanced financial methodologies, effectively addresses the challenges posed by external supply chain disruptions and internal budget recalibrations. By mitigating currency risk and securing better purchasing conditions, the project ensures the continuity of operations and financial stability. It is recommended to proceed with the proposed solution to avoid significant financial losses and optimize asset replacement.
